# Tail-Recursion-Optimization
- [Tail recursion optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_call) eliminates the need for extra stack space when executing recursive functions. 
- To apply this optimization the recursive calls must be the last operation in the function.
- This code compares the performance of a recursive implementation for calculating a number from fibonacci sequence. 
- Running this code will plot the execution time with and without the optimization.

# How to Run
1. `npm install`
2. `node plot.js`
